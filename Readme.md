## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prompt Profiles** | Save & manage pairs of positive + negative prompts as named profiles. Switch, rename, delete, or reorder them instantly. |
| **Negative Prompt Support** | Every profile includes a dedicated negative prompt field ‚Äî not just positive! |
| **Global Variables (`{name}`)** | Use placeholders like `{miku}` that expand to full prompts (e.g., `twintail, blue hair, aqua eyes`). |
| **Wildcards (`[name]`)** | Insert random values from a list: `[character]` ‚Üí `miku`, `teto`, or `luka`. |
| **Danbooru Integration** | Fetch tags directly from Danbooru by post ID. Auto-remove unwanted tags (e.g., `text`, `watermark`, `white background`). |

| **Dark Mode & Draggable UI** | Toggle dark/light theme. Move the üìù icon anywhere on screen. |
| **Full Backup & Restore** | Export/import everything: profiles, variables, wildcards, blacklist, and settings ‚Äî as a single `.json` file. |
